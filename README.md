# Tooncentrate

Tooncentrate is a simple interval timer that, by default, will play a random selection of notes from the E Natural Minor
scale every six minutes.

Requests and PRs welcome.

## Installation
In the same directory as this README.md file, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You should then be able to run the application in Python.

## Usage
Right now there is no interface other than starting the timer. If you're in the same directory, just run:

`python main.py`

Issue a good ol' `Ctrl+C` to stop the timer.
